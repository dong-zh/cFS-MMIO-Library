# Memory Mapped IO Library

A basic MMIO Library that tries to use some of CFE's API. This version assumes a Linux OS and uses platform specific functions.

This library is used with my [cFS FPGA App](https://github.com/dong-zh/cFS-FPGA). It's more of a proof of concept, and should *not* be used in any serious applications.
